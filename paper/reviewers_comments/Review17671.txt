Reviewer 1 of CDC 2023 submission 1116

Comments to the author
======================

The authors present the software package MPT+ available for
MATLAB. They show the theoretical background and a tutorial
on how to implement it for explicit tube MPC and complexity
reduction with polynomial approximation. The results are
demonstrated on a numerical simulation and an application.
The paper is well
written. 
The reviewer has some suggestions to improve the work:
1. The difference with the work [24] is not clear, since
both paper present the MPT+ toolbox and [24] is not yet
available.
2. In (1) and (2) two different representations for the
disturbance (w and d) are given. It is not clear, why the
authors uses two different representations. One would
suffice. 
3. Below (11), the authors wrote "The norm is considered as
$p \in {1,\infty}$, i.e., the cost function (11a) is
linear." In my opinion, neither a 1-norm nor a
infinity-norm leads a linear cost. 
4. In the code below of (16) the abbreviation TMPC is used.
I would suggest to explain the meaning of the "T". 
5. The code examples, in the right column of the 4th page
show how to generate plots. This rises the expectation to
see the mentioned plots also in the paper.
