Comments to the author
======================

The paper presents a new software package MPT+ extenting
the well known Multi-Parametric-Toolbox (MPT). The aim of
the software package is to support MPC development and
application by, e.g., reducing memory usage for explicit
MPC laws or supporting industrial applications. MPT+
fucusses on tube-based robust MPC with rate constraints and
(lightweight) polynomial approximations of explicit MPC. 

The authors give an introduction to the fundamental
theory, guiding and cursory information on how to use MPT+,
and two studies proving MPT+'s function. The paper is
mostly well-written but the authors should consider to
delete some "the" before nouns that are adressed in
general. e.g: "[...] operations over (the) convex sets." or
"Although
(the) MPC has been intensively studied [...]". Moreover,
the are many typos (see minor comments below).

Two major comments are:

- I tried to implement the given
(numerical) example with the provided matlab code on github
(see the project's wiki on github). A successfull
test of the example "Tube MPC design" failed since
the computation of the robust invariant set did not
converge. Please double-check or fix this issue before
publication of the paper and library. 

- Just giving information about the hardware for
the numerical studies is not very informative. Please add
compuational times etc. or consider to compare MPT2/3 with
MPT+. 

Minor Comments:

- Please check Eq. (10). Should one term not be "-K*F_{x,i}
x(k)"?
- Page 1 - non-liner MPC / non-linear MPC
- Page 2 - E \in \mathbb{R}^{n_x x n_w} is n_d
meant (?)
- Page 2 - fast-dynamics called Flexy2 [25]. (?) 
- Page 3 - available on GitHub.
- Page 2 - add relation between \hat{u}_k and
\kappa(x(t))
- Page 2 - what is K and how to compute it?
- add to Eq. (16) bounds of d 
- Delete "into" in "to be implemented into to the uncertain
LTI" or considert to rewrite the whole sentence.

In summary, I recommend to accept the paper and I wish the
authors all the best for a sucessfull launch of MPT+.
However, please double-check the github code and check the
paper for typos / language.
