Comments to the author
======================

The paper describes a toolbox for MPC with interesting
additional features compared to other toolboxes in the
literature. The article is well written and the relevance
is basically related to its possible use for industrial
applications.
I only have a simple request to make the manuscript more
effective: I think that the target models/system complexity
should be better addressed, in terms of number of states,
constraints, and overall size of the problem while
fulfilling hard real-time requirements.
